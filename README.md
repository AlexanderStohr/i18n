## Special instructions
* Please do not translate texts in curly braces, e.g. {time}, {user}, {certainty}, those placeholders are programmatically replaced
* If you don't want to translate a text, please keep it in English instead of deleting it. We don't have English fallback for missing identifiers.

## Testing
* Please follow the [instructions on developing and testing your translation](https://scrumpy.poker/2020/09/20/gitlab-sorting-and-voting-improvements-in-release-sep-20-2020/) with the new PASTEBIN integration. You can edit the texts through a PASTEBIN paste and receive immediate update of the look and feel of the application. This way you'll know how the application will look like before the official release.
